# Movie Search and Favorites

A full-stack web application that allows users to search movies using the OMDb API and manage their favorites list.  
The project demonstrates a modular full-stack architecture with **Next.js (React, TanStack Query)** for the frontend and **NestJS (Node.js)** for the backend.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js 15 (React)
- TanStack Query (React Query)
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript

**Backend**
- NestJS
- Axios (for OMDb API integration)
- In-memory data store for favorites

---

## Features
Search movies via OMDb API  
View title, year, and poster in a responsive grid  
Add or remove favorites (stored in memory)  
Favorites page with cached results  
Pagination / infinite scroll for search results  
Mobile-friendly layout with TailwindCSS  
Clear modular codebase

---

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| GET | `/movies/search?q=<query>` | Search for movies using OMDb |
| GET | `/favorites` | Retrieve all favorite movies |
| POST | `/favorites` | Add a movie to favorites |
| DELETE | `/favorites/:imdbID` | Remove a movie from favorites |

---

## Architecture Overview

**Frontend**
- `useMovies()` fetches paginated movie data  
- `useFavorites()` manages add, remove, and list mutations  
- `MovieCard` component displays each movie with a favorite toggle  
- TanStack Query handles caching and background refetching

**Backend**
- `/movies` module queries OMDb API and returns simplified results  
- `/favorites` module manages an in-memory list of favorite movies  
- CORS enabled for local frontend communication

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eshreyareddy/movie-search-favorites.git

cd movie-search-favorites

3. Run the backend
cd backend

npm install

npm run start:dev
Server runs on http://localhost:4000

4. Run the frontend
cd ../frontend

npm install

npm run dev
Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

 Bonus Enhancements
If this were deployed to production, Iâ€™d add:

Persistent favorites (SQLite or Supabase)

API rate-limit caching (Redis)

Auth (Supabase / Auth.js)

Docker deployment

CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

 **UI Preview**
Responsive movie grid with favorite toggles and pagination.

**Reasoning**
This project uses Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for better interactivity and easier caching through TanStack Query.
If SEO were a priority, switching to SSR would be trivial in Next.js.
